<h1>HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption</h1>

<h3> < figure >< /figure ></h3>
<p>Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new element to contain images and their captions so that the two are associated.<br>
You can have more than one image inside the element as long as they all share the same caption.</p>

<h3> < figcaption >< /figcaption ></h3>
<p>The element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.<br>
Before these elements were created there was no way to associate an element with its caption.<br>
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements simply ignore the new elements and display the content of them.</p>
<br>
<img src="assests/pictures/1.jfif" width="200pixels"><figcaption>This image is wonderful. The caption is in the figcaption tags.</figcaption></img>
<br>
<img src="assests/pictures/3.jfif" width="200pixels"><figcaption>This is a second image. The caption is in the figcaption tags.</figcaption></img>
